Okay, I understand that the task involves evaluating the performance of a search engine using two metrics, precision@10 and mean average precision (MAP), based on a set of system runs and relevance judgments files. The evaluation scores will be computed per system-per topic and then averaged to compute overall scores for each system. The correlation coefficient and significance testing will be computed to compare the performance of different systems and determine if the differences in their scores are significant.

To get started, I would suggest following these steps:

Download the input files and qrels files from the TREC website.
Parse the input files and extract the relevant information, such as the query IDs and document IDs.
Parse the qrels files and extract the relevance judgments for each query and document pair.
Implement the precision@10 and MAP metrics using the extracted information.
Apply the metrics to each system run and compute the per system-per topic scores.
Average the per system-per topic scores to compute the overall precision@10 and MAP scores for each system.
Compute the correlation coefficient between the precision@10 and MAP scores using a statistical tool such as Pearson's correlation coefficient.
Conduct significance testing between pairs of systems/input files using a statistical tool such as the t-test or ANOVA.
I hope this helps you get started with the task. Let me know if you have any further questions!
