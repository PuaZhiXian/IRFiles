The format of a qrels file is as follows:

TOPIC      ITERATION      DOCUMENT#      RELEVANCY

where TOPIC is the topic number,
ITERATION is the feedback iteration (almost always zero and not used),
DOCUMENT# is the official document number that corresponds to the "docno" field in the documents, and
RELEVANCY is a binary code of 0 for not relevant and 1 for relevant.
